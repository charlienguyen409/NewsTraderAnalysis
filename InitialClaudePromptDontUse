# Start Prompt for Claude Code

Build a full-stack market analysis application with a React frontend and Python backend that analyzes financial news to generate trading recommendations.

**Frontend (React + TypeScript + Tailwind):**
- Dashboard with "Analyze Market" button to trigger analysis on-demand
- Position recommendations display with confidence scores and reasoning
- Article browser to view/search all scraped content
- Activity log showing real-time agent actions and analysis steps
- Settings panel to configure number of positions, analysis parameters, and a dropdown to specify which LLM models to use. The minimum is to offer all the latest OpenAI GPT and Claude Models

**Backend (FastAPI + PostgreSQL):**
- RESTful API with WebSocket support for real-time updates
- Comeup with amazing prompts for LLM to use
- Scrape financial news from FinViz and BizToc with proper rate limiting and use OPENAI/Claude to analyze which headlines to cherrypick and scrape
- Use OpenAI/Claude for sentiment analysis and catalyst detection (no keyword matching) 
- Store all data in PostgreSQL with proper indexing
- Generate BUY/SHORT recommendations with detailed reasoning

The system should be production-ready with Docker support, comprehensive error handling, and a clean, modern UI that makes it easy to understand the agent's analysis process and trading recommendations.
