# API Endpoint Refactor: Market Summary

## Overview
Refactored the `/api/v1/analysis/market-summary/` endpoint to return cached market summaries generated during analysis runs instead of generating summaries on-demand.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Import Dependencies
**File**: `backend/app/api/routes/analysis.py`
- Added `market_summary_crud` to imports from `services.crud`

### 2. Completely Refactored `get_latest_market_summary()` Function
**File**: `backend/app/api/routes/analysis.py`

#### Previous Behavior:
- Generated new market summary on every request
- Queried last 24 hours of articles, analyses, and positions directly
- Called LLM service to generate fresh summary
- Resource-intensive and slow

#### New Behavior:
- Fetches most recent `MarketSummary` record from database
- Returns cached summary with metadata about generation context
- Fast response time with no LLM calls
- Includes analysis session information and cache metadata

### 3. Enhanced CRUD Operations
**File**: `backend/app/services/crud.py`
- Added `get_latest_market_summary()` method to `MarketSummaryCRUD` class
- This method retrieves the most recent market summary across all analysis sessions

## API Response Structure

### When Summary Exists (Cached Response):
```json
{
  // Original LLM-generated summary data
  "overall_sentiment": "...",
  "sentiment_score": 0.15,
  "key_themes": [...],
  "stocks_to_watch": [...],
  "notable_catalysts": [...],
  "risk_factors": [...],
  "summary": "...",
  
  // Analysis metadata
  "analysis_session_id": "uuid",
  "analysis_type": "full|headlines", 
  "model_used": "gpt-4o-mini",
  "data_sources": {
    "articles_analyzed": 45,
    "sentiment_analyses": 32,
    "positions_generated": 8,
    "unique_tickers": 15
  },
  
  // Cache information
  "cache_metadata": {
    "summary_id": "uuid",
    "generated_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "is_cached": true,
    "cache_age_hours": 2.3
  }
}
```

### When No Summary Exists (Fallback):
```json
{
  "message": "No market analysis has been run yet.",
  "summary": "Please trigger a market analysis first to generate a market summary.",
  "generated_at": "2024-01-15T12:45:00Z",
  "data_sources": {
    "articles_analyzed": 0,
    "sentiment_analyses": 0,
    "positions_generated": 0
  },
  "analysis_session": null,
  "analysis_type": null,
  "model_used": null
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Instant response time vs. 10-30 second LLM generation
2. **Cost Efficiency**: No API calls to OpenAI/Anthropic on each request
3. **Consistency**: Same summary returned until new analysis is run
4. **Transparency**: Users know when summary was generated and from which analysis
5. **Metadata Rich**: Includes session ID, analysis type, model used, and cache age

## Impact on User Experience

- **Frontend**: Market summary loads instantly
- **API Usage**: Reduced bandwidth and faster response times
- **Analysis Flow**: Summary now reflects actual analysis runs rather than ad-hoc data queries
- **Debugging**: Easy to trace which analysis session generated each summary

## Dependencies

This refactor depends on:
- `MarketSummary` model (created by Agent 1)
- `MarketSummaryCRUD` class with required methods
- Analysis service generating and storing summaries during analysis runs

## Future Considerations

- Could add endpoint parameter to get summaries from specific sessions
- May want to add TTL or freshness indicators for very old cached summaries
- Consider adding endpoint to clear/refresh specific cached summaries
