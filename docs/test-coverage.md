pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-report=xml --cov-report=term

# Generate coverage for specific modules
pytest tests/unit/ --cov=app.services --cov-report=html
pytest tests/integration/ --cov=app.api --cov-report=html

# Generate critical path coverage
pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=html --cov-config=.coveragerc-critical
```

#### Frontend Coverage Report Generation
```bash
# Generate comprehensive coverage report
cd frontend
npm run test:coverage

# Generate coverage for specific components
npm test -- --coverage --collectCoverageFrom="src/components/**/*.{ts,tsx}"

# Generate critical path coverage
npm test -- --coverage --testPathPattern="integration"
```

### Coverage Report Dashboard

#### Coverage Metrics Dashboard
```typescript
// coverage-dashboard.ts
interface CoverageMetrics {
  overall: {
    line: number;
    branch: number;
    function: number;
    statement: number;
  };
  components: {
    [key: string]: ComponentCoverage;
  };
  trends: CoverageTrend[];
  gaps: CoverageGap[];
}

interface ComponentCoverage {
  name: string;
  coverage: number;
  target: number;
  status: 'good' | 'needs-work' | 'poor';
  lastUpdated: string;
}
```

### CI/CD Coverage Integration

#### GitHub Actions Coverage Workflow
```yaml
- name: Generate Coverage Report
  run: |
    cd backend
    pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=xml
    cd ../frontend
    npm run test:coverage

- name: Upload Coverage to Codecov
  uses: codecov/codecov-action@v3
  with:
    files: ./backend/coverage.xml,./frontend/coverage/lcov.info
    fail_ci_if_error: true
    verbose: true

- name: Coverage Check
  run: |
    python scripts/check-coverage-targets.py
```

#### Coverage Quality Gates
```python
# scripts/check-coverage-targets.py
COVERAGE_TARGETS = {
    'backend_overall': 80,
    'frontend_overall': 80,
    'api_endpoints': 90,
    'service_layer': 85,
    'react_components': 80,
    'critical_paths': 90
}

def check_coverage_targets():
    """Check if coverage meets targets and fail if not"""
    coverage_data = load_coverage_data()
    
    for component, target in COVERAGE_TARGETS.items():
        actual = coverage_data.get(component, 0)
        if actual < target:
            print(f"❌ {component}: {actual}% < {target}% target")
            return False
        else:
            print(f"✅ {component}: {actual}% >= {target}% target")
    
    return True
```

## Best Practices

### Writing Testable Code

#### Backend Best Practices
```python
# Good: Testable service with dependency injection
class AnalysisService:
    def __init__(self, db: AsyncSession, llm_service: LLMService):
        self.db = db
        self.llm_service = llm_service
    
    async def analyze_article(self, article: Article) -> Analysis:
        # Business logic here
        pass

# Good: Clear separation of concerns
async def test_analysis_service_creates_analysis():
    # Arrange
    mock_llm = Mock()
    mock_llm.analyze_sentiment.return_value = mock_analysis_result
    service = AnalysisService(db_session, mock_llm)
    
    # Act
    result = await service.analyze_article(test_article)
    
    # Assert
    assert result.sentiment_score == expected_score
    mock_llm.analyze_sentiment.assert_called_once()
```

#### Frontend Best Practices
```typescript
// Good: Component with clear props interface
interface PositionCardProps {
  position: Position;
  onClick?: (position: Position) => void;
  className?: string;
}

export const PositionCard: React.FC<PositionCardProps> = ({
  position,
  onClick,
  className
}) => {
  // Component implementation
};

// Good: Testable hook with clear dependencies
export const useAnalysis = (sessionId: string) => {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['analysis', sessionId],
    queryFn: () => api.getAnalysisStatus(sessionId),
    enabled: !!sessionId
  });
};
```

### Coverage Analysis Best Practices

1. **Focus on Behavior, Not Lines**
   - Prioritize testing business logic over getters/setters
   - Test edge cases and error scenarios
   - Ensure critical user paths are covered

2. **Use Coverage as a Guide, Not a Goal**
   - 100% coverage doesn't guarantee quality
   - Focus on meaningful tests over coverage percentage
   - Review uncovered code for necessity

3. **Regular Coverage Review**
   - Review coverage reports weekly
   - Identify and address coverage gaps promptly
   - Update coverage targets as code evolves

4. **Coverage in Code Reviews**
   - Require tests for new features
   - Review coverage impact of changes
   - Ensure critical paths remain covered
